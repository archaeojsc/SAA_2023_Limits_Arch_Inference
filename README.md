Fifty years ago, what was arguably the most important paper ever written for
modern work in quantitative archaeology was published in American Antiquity.
Unfortunately for its author, and generations of archaeologists, few took notice
of it at the time. With few citations, more than half of which have occurred in
just the last few years, its elegance and mathematical precision went largely
unappreciated -- even by the growing cohorts of computational and quantitative
archaeologists whose work would have greatly benefited from it. In this paper,
we demonstrate that John Justeson's 1973 article "Limitations of Archaeological
Inference" was not only accurate and precise in its implications, but also very
much still at the forefront of archaeological thought... even if the field at
large doesn't yet realize it.
